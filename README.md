# LEqual

"LEqual" is a portmanteau of of "legal" and "equal."

This project is an effort to make the law more accessible. As the legal system of the United States of America stands right now, there are incongruities between what public perception of "the law" is and what it is (as enforced), and more basic inconsistencies in its application. The goal is to expand understanding of the law as it affects peoples' lives, an attempt to better understand (for myself) programming, and an exploration of the use of "smart contracts," in order to resolve the aforementioned deficiencies.
