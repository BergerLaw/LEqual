The goal is to provide the Official Code of Georgia Annotated — now freed from the copyright claims by the State of Georgia — with all.

Usually the goal of using a git is to provide some level of version control (and history). Unfortunately, I am not currently aware of a version of the Code that is particularly conducive to using version control (because of formatting). What I may end up doing is just uploading the Code in several different formats, and seeing what tends to work best in the long term. If anyone has any better ideas or skills that could help out (e.g., my skill for converting the files to something more versatile, such as XML or perhaps even JSON(?)), please feel free to share those ideas!

In good trouble,
Justin
